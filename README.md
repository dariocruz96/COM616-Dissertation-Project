# COM616-Dissertation-Project
This repository will work as my logbook to keep track of research and notes for the dissertation project as well as implementation steps.

## Technology Options

1. **Backend Framework: Flask or Django (Python)**
   - Django is a more feature-rich, high-level framework.

2. **Database: PostgreSQL or SQLite (with Django)**
   - PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database.
   - SQLite is a lightweight database suitable for smaller projects.

3. **Frontend Framework: React (JavaScript)**
   - React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

4. **Web Server: Nginx or Apache**
   - Nginx and Apache are widely used web servers that can serve your application.

5. **Deployment and Hosting: AWS (Amazon Web Services)**
   - Use AWS for hosting your web app. AWS offers services like EC2 for virtual servers, RDS for managed databases, and S3 for storage.

6. **Containerization: Docker**
   - Docker allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a container, making it easy to deploy and run consistently across different environments.

7. **Container Orchestration: Docker Compose or Kubernetes**
   - Docker Compose is suitable for smaller projects, while Kubernetes is a powerful solution for larger, more complex deployments.

8. **Authentication: Django-Allauth (OAuth with Django)**
   - Implement OAuth for secure authentication.

9. **Task Scheduling: Celery (with Django)**
   - Use Celery for handling asynchronous tasks, such as generating the weekly rota.

10. **Frontend Styling: Bootstrap or Material-UI (with React)**
    - Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework for responsive design.
    - Material-UI is a set of React components implementing Google's Material Design.

11. **Version Control: Git and GitHub**
    - Use Git for version control and GitHub for hosting your repository.

12. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): GitHub Actions**
    - Set up CI/CD to automate testing and deployment processes.

13. **SSL/TLS: Let's Encrypt**
    - Secure your web app with HTTPS using Let's Encrypt.

14. **Monitoring: AWS CloudWatch or Prometheus**
    - Monitor your application's performance and logs.

15. **DNS: Amazon Route 53 or Cloudflare**
    - Manage your domain and DNS settings.
