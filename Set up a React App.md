## Install Node.js and npm

If you haven't already, install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your system. You can download and install them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Create a React App

Use Create React App, a popular tool for creating React applications with a pre-configured build setup. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```
Replace my-react-app with the name of your React project directory.

Navigate to Your React App Directory
After the project is created, navigate to your React app directory using the terminal:

```bash
cd my-react-app
```

Start the React Development Server
Start the development server for your React app by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will compile your React code and open your default web browser to display your React app running locally. By default, the development server runs on port 3000.

Verify Installation
After running the npm start command, you should see the default React welcome page in your browser. This indicates that your React app is set up correctly.

```vbnet
With these steps, you have successfully created a new React app outside your Django project directory. You can now develop your React components, build your user interface, and integrate it with your Django backend as needed.
